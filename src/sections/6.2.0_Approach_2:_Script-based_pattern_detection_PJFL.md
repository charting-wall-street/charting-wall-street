A second approach to detecting algorithms in the stock market is by trying to detect the algorithms programmatically. This is in contrast with the previous approach, in which we wanted to detect the algorithms automatically. When detecting the algorithms automatically, we did not have a clear view on what the outcome might be, so working in reverse means that we know what we are trying to detect, and have to write a detector starting from the shape of the pattern we are trying to find.

Since there are many patterns in the market, we have selected a few patterns to detect. The most basic patterns that we are trying to find is the double bottom and double top pattern. From the literature, one would expect a move after these patterns, in the case of a double bottom, this would be an upwards move, and vice versa for the double top pattern.

When we have a double top detector, we can easily adapt this detector to detect double bottom patterns. With a bit more complexity, we can also identify triple top and triple bottom patterns, as well as head-and-shoulder patterns. We will explain how we can detect those patterns easily with the finished pipeline.

Once we have a good detector, we can start validating the occurrences of these patterns on the whole of the dataset and validate whether these patterns have any significant predicting power, and thus answer the question of this thesis.
