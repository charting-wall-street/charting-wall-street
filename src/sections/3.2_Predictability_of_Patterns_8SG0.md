Technical analysis has historically played a pivotal role in forecasting price movements, but its efficacy remains a subject of ongoing debate. A comprehensive study "A literature review of technical analysis on stock markets" [@Silva_Sobreiro_Kimura_2017] examined the state of the field, offering insights that delineate both its strengths and existing gaps.

Economic Context: One noteworthy observation is the disproportionate focus on advanced economies. Of the 85 articles surveyed, 53 pertained to stock markets in advanced countries, leaving a mere 23 to address developing economies. This imbalance reveals a discernible gap in the literature, indicating a dearth of explorations into the efficacy of technical analysis within developing or emerging economies, such as the BRICS nations.

Methodological Divergences: The methodologies deployed in these studies further underscore the disparities in scholarly focus. Among the surveyed works, chart patterns were scarcely represented, making appearances in a mere 2 of the 85 papers. This indicates a potential avenue for future research, particularly in examining whether the integration of chart patterns with advanced pattern recognition algorithms might enhance the forecast of abnormal returns.

Operational Tools: A closer inspection of the analytical tools revealed a pronounced inclination towards moving averages and statistical analyses. However, a conspicuous gap exists in merging technical analysis with modern analytical methodologies. The potential for integrating technical analysis with tools such as machine learning remains largely unexplored and presents a promising avenue for future studies.

Profitability, Predictability, and Risk are three foundational aspects of technical analysis, with risk-adjusted return being a key component. Risk-adjusted return is a measure that takes into account both the profit and the level of risk involved in achieving that profit, providing a more comprehensive view of an investment's performance. Many studies support the benefits of technical analysis, but the omission of risk-adjusted returns in some research raises concerns. By neglecting this critical measure, the studies may present an incomplete picture of the investment's true potential and thus cast doubt on the validity of their findings. Additionally, the potential for publication bias may lead to an overrepresentation of studies confirming the effectiveness of technical patterns, thereby skewering the overall perception of the utility of technical analysis.

In summary, while there exists a robust body of literature attesting to the merits of technical analysis, this survey highlights pressing gaps in the field. The exploration and empirical validation of foundational chart patterns remain untapped areas.
