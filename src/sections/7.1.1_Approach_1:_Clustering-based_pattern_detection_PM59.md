The preliminary focus of the investigation involved a clustering-based technique for pattern detection. This method was initially chosen to counteract the labor-intensive nature of manual pattern detection by employing machine learning algorithms to identify trading patterns automatically. The fundamental premise behind this approach was the idea that recurring patterns in the market should be more frequent than random ones, and therefore, could be effectively grouped together.

Dynamic time warping (DTW) was employed as a tool to identify these recurrent patterns, independent of their temporal intervals. This method was designed to streamline the pattern detection process and enhance efficiency, on the assumption that these recurring patterns would display a consistent merging pattern in their frequency of occurrence.

Nevertheless, this initial approach was met with significant challenges that impeded its successful execution. Contrary to the original assumptions, the clustering method yielded numerous high-occurrence patterns rather than a select group of common ones, which required a reassessment of the methodological strategy.

Both the bottom-up and top-down clustering strategies posed computational and memory usage challenges, making this method impractical for the aims. Furthermore, the patterns identified via this approach lacked clear, interpretable structures and appeared more akin to random noise than meaningful market behaviors.

In response to these challenges and in pursuit of the central research question concerning the effectiveness of trading patterns, we decided to explore alternative pattern detection techniques. These new approaches aimed to provide a more nuanced understanding of the behavior and appearance of trading patterns in the market, potentially offering valuable insights that might inform a future reconsideration of the clustering method.
