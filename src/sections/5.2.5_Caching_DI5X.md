<!-- Caching part two -->
In the context of caching, we apply the same approach as employed in caching candle blocks within the candle service. However, we utilize a smaller cache size, typically around 2GB, as indicators are not reused as frequently as candle blocks. Nonetheless, incorporating a cache remains crucial for achieving the optimal performance observed in the pipeline.

<!-- Handling different intervals, resolutions, and parameters -->
In contrast to candle sets, indicators involve an additional parameter to consider. We refer to this parameter as the "list of parameters" associated with a specific indicator. As previously mentioned in the context of caching, this introduces a slight increase in complexity as we need to distinguish results based on different parameters. However, aside from this distinction, it does not pose any significant challenges.
