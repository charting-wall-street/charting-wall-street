Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) serves as a sophisticated algorithm for assessing similarity between temporal sequences, which may vary in length. Within the financial sector, its utility has been recognized for analyzing sequences in financial time series, such as stock price movements.

In the study titled "What makes trading strategies based on chart pattern recognition profitable?" [@Tsinaslanidis_Guijarro_2021], the primary focus was on the development of a trading system that leverages DTW to identify generic patterns that have historically shown profitability. Contrary to traditional trading approaches that are anchored to predetermined technical patterns, this methodology adopted a more expansive view. The research encompassed an analysis of 560 NYSE stocks, meticulously evaluating the system's efficacy in relation to factors such as pattern length and the defined take-profit and stop-loss levels.

The principal takeaways from the research encompass several distinct insights. First, the study showcased the viability of trading systems that expand beyond traditional boundaries, identifying any chart pattern historically tied to profitability rather than relying solely on predetermined technical patterns. Next, the research established a clear correlation between the length of the pattern and the efficacy of the trading system, suggesting that more elongated patterns might serve as more robust indicators. Additionally, the 'take-profit' metric was found to be vital in enhancing system performance, whereas the 'stop-loss' metric had a more subdued impact. Finally, the system, after adjusting for transaction costs, generated modest but consistent returns, surpassing conventional benchmarks when the optimal parameters were applied. Together, these findings underline the innovative application of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in trading strategies, illustrating the potential of this novel approach.

To summarize, the research accentuates the potential of integrating dynamic time warping in the formulation of trading strategies. With the recognition of any historically profitable pattern and not solely relying on established ones, the study presents a novel approach.
