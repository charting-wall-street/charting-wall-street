Numerous scientific papers generally assess their trading strategies using a limited set of stocks in a limited amount of time. The selection of these stocks is often influenced by their contemporary popularity or historical significance, leading to inherent bias [@Rolemberg_Rolemberg_Koike]. A majority of these chosen stocks are typically successful companies that have weathered various economic trials over the past decades. As a result, investing in such stocks has historically resulted in profits due to their average upward trajectory.

Apple exemplifies a stock that is frequently utilized in these evaluations. Its trajectory of success is unparalleled, recently underscored by its achievement of surpassing the 3 trillion dollar valuation mark, making it the most valuable company in the world at this point in time. However, it is crucial to recognize that very few corporations have attained or sustained such monumental success as Apple. By focusing algorithms predominantly on stocks like Apple, there's an inadvertent bias introduced, favoring consistently stable and prosperous companies that appear unlikely to experience downturns in the foreseeable future.

To diminish this bias, the goal is to generate a comprehensive catalogue of publicly traded stocks. This method permits the recognition of patterns in both small and large corporations. Still, the selection procedure is not entirely free from bias. To exclude graphs with excessive noise, companies with a market capitalization below $200 million at the time of writing this paper are left out. Stocks with a long history are also given precedence to facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation. As a result, the dataset naturally encompasses stocks mainly linked to successful companies. Nonetheless, it is believed that this approach offers a more representative view of the market, and trading strategies with robust risk management can still exploit patterns observed in high-value company stocks, potentially yielding superior results than when relying on a restricted dataset.

While excluding smaller companies, it is impractical to test the algorithm on every single stock that has ever existed. Including all US-traded symbols would result in a list exceeding 10,000 symbols spanning various kinds of stocks, funds, and financial assets. Since the primary focus lies on common stocks, symbols that do not represent common stocks are filtered out. Moreover, derivative stocks, often denoted by letters like X or U, are excluded to further refine the list.

After reviewing random stocks from the residual list, it becomes clear that many of these are small firms with charts that lack value due to low trading volume or limited historical data. To tackle this issue, the list is refined to only include NYSE symbols, thus eliminating smaller companies. This measure trims the list down to roughly 6,000 publicly traded symbols.

A list of 6,000 stocks still proves unwieldy for thorough evaluation and may include smaller companies with unusual charts resulting from irregular splits or occurrences like share creation to uphold specific price levels. The primary interest lies in patterns emerging from market trading activities. To further streamline the list, market capitalization data for each company is collected for each year of their existence. This information is used to prune the list based on company valuation by choosing the 250 largest companies for each quarter.

The final filtering criterion pertains to the duration of existence. Several companies in the dataset might have only operated for a few years, making their long-term performance evaluation challenging. To address this issue, any company that does not boast at least 20 years of historical data is discarded. This refinement procedure yields a final list of approximately 500 symbols[^2], which are used as the dataset for pattern detection.

While the data quality has been broadly evaluated, there might still be some gaps in the completeness of the dataset. Particularly, data points at the beginning of each stock's timeline may lack the same depth as more recent data due to the digitization process. However, since the objective is to evaluate patterns over a significant timeframe, these points are included to gain insights into historical patterns.

Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that the chosen selection of the dataset introduces a potential bias known as survivorship bias [@Kan_Kirikos_Halpern_Andrew]. By focusing on stocks that have a long history of existence, stocks that may have ceased trading or experienced substantial declines are unintentionally excluded. As a result, the dataset primarily consists of stocks that have persisted and flourished over time. This survivorship bias should be considered when interpreting the results and generalizing them to the broader stock market.

In conclusion, the methodology involves choosing the 250 largest companies each quarter from 1986 to 2022 and filtering out companies with a market capitalization below $200 million or less than 20 years of historical data. This stringent filtering process culminates in a dataset comprising just over 500 symbols, serving as the bedrock for detecting patterns in the research. By focusing on substantial and well-established companies, the aim is to procure a comprehensive and representative dataset for accurate pattern analysis.
