Indicator definitions often involve intricate mathematical expressions that are not easily distilled into a few lines of code. The intricacy becomes more pronounced when one indicator relies on another, complicating their translation into conventional scripting languages.

The approach to handling these challenges involves a systematic stepping mechanism through each time interval, be it a minute, hour, or any other defined period. By progressing one step at a time, we're able to calculate the value of an indicator for each moment. Ideally, if the calculation at each step is of linear complexity, the entire process should be achievable in linear time.

To simplify and standardize the representation of these indicators, we've abstracted the calculation logic behind interfaces. The primary structure for this purpose uses a "Moment" type. This "Moment" acts as a container for current data, the preceding data value in the series, and any associated parameters. By passing this "Moment" to the respective indicator's function, we aim to represent a broad spectrum of indicators comprehensively.

For instance, a complex indicator like the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) requires an initialization function. We cannot simply start calculations from an assumed 'beginning of time,' as traditional mathematical formulas might suggest. On the other hand, Bollinger Bands represent an example of an indicator dependent on another, specifically the Simple Moving Average.

However, some advanced indicators, like diagonal resistance lines, may not fit this stepwise, series-generation model due to their unique requirements. While we've built the system to accommodate a wide range of indicators, it is essential to understand that some complexities extend beyond the boundaries set by the interfaces. Additionally, while the indicators are designed to be efficient and integrated within the service, they are not directly used for pattern detection due to the nuances in how patterns and indicators differ in their computations.
