The candles stored on disk are referred to as "Primitive Candles" because they serve as the foundation for calculating other intervals. For example, if the service requires hourly candles, one option would be to fetch them from the connected data brokers. However, this would increase the number of requests, which is subject to rate limitations. Instead, we derive any candle block with an interval larger than the Primitive Candle set.

Initially, we worked with minute data, and therefore the Primitive Candle sets were stored accordingly. However, in the case of stock data, the most historical information is only available as daily candles. This led us to introduce support for multiple "resolutions." In the context of candle blocks, resolution indicates the interval of the Primitive Candle set they are based on. This allows us to retrieve daily candles dating back decades while also utilizing minute data when necessary, as long as the required Primitive Candles are available.
