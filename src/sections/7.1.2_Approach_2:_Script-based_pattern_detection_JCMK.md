In the second approach to detecting stock market patterns, a script-based detection method was utilized. Unlike the first method which relied on automatic detection, this approach specifically targeted known patterns using tailored scripts.

The choice of patterns focused specifically on the double bottom and double top patterns, as these are often associated with reversal signals in the market. These patterns were chosen for three primary reasons: their frequent occurrence in market data, their simple and discernible structure, and the prevailing consensus in market literature that they typically indicate a reversal in price movements, such as a change from a downtrend to an uptrend, as highlighted in the literature review.

Once the script-based detector was operational, the dataset was scanned for these patterns. This process allowed for an assessment of their predictive strength, thus addressing this thesis's main question - the efficacy and relevance of these trading patterns.

Findings indicated that detection accuracy can fluctuate based on market horizons. Specifically, shorter horizons may introduce additional noise and volatility, leading to an uptick in pattern occurrences. Yet, even with these potential hurdles, the script-based approach consistently identified patterns within the market data.

Central to the script-based method is the identification of market highs and lows â€“ crucial for pinpointing patterns. While the technique faced challenges, such as integrating various data sources and managing anomalies like tied candles (candles that have identical bodies and wicks, often due to data gaps being filled with duplicated candles from earlier periods), it effectively sidestepped these issues, preventing the incorporation of incorrect patterns.

In summary, the script-based method successfully detected five prevalent trading patterns: double bottom, double top, triple bottom, triple top, and heads-and-shoulders. An in-depth analysis of these patterns' predictive abilities is the focus of the upcoming sections of this thesis.
