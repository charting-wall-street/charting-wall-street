# Preface {-}

I want to begin by thanking both Prof. Dr. Yvan Saeys and Arne Gevaert, who provided their expertise and guidance on this thesis and continued to support me throughout the year. Given that this thesis began as a proposal, I'm deeply grateful to have been given this opportunity to work on it.

I'd also like to thank my friends and family for their support: from cooking in the evenings to standing by me during good and buggy times.

The subject of this thesis has been on my mind for years, but never had the skills or time to execute properly. Being able to write this thesis with the languages, tools, and knowledge I've built up over the years, truly feels like the high point of my academic journey.

This thesis delves into a substantial amount of economic terminology. However, explanations are available in the background section. While the foundation of this thesis is computer science, those from an economic background, possessing a basic grasp of programming, should be able to follow the majority of the content.
