<!-- Initial pattern formation using event sequences -->

With the available events, they are partitioned into windows, where each window consists of a specific number of sequences. In this example, there are four sequences for each type of indicator, and the events within these sequences are denoted as integers. The timeline of events is divided into a predetermined number of days corresponding to the window size, with an overlap of a specified number of days to ensure comprehensive coverage. Positive market events are represented by the integer 1, negative events by -1, and the absence of an event by 0. This results in straightforward sequences of data that can be efficiently processed by machine learning algorithms, utilizing this abstract data to draw meaningful conclusions.

The decision to represent events as integers stems from their significant performance improvements when employing the distance algorithm. Although alternatives, such as using floats, were considered, the choice was made to represent events as integers. By utilizing floats, it would be possible to merge algorithms and assign float values to events, indicating a reduced level of certainty when events are combined. However, this would incur additional computational time and increase the complexity of the distance algorithm. While it simplifies the clustering process, it introduces additional overhead.

An alternative approach was contemplated, considering the utilization of floats to encode more data within the sequences instead of discrete events. This additional data could include information such as the distance between exponential moving average (ema) lines to anticipate crosses or the proximity to a new line of the relative strength index (rsi). However, this approach would involve dealing with continuous data, while the intention is to work specifically with events. Consequently, this idea was swiftly dismissed. It is worth noting that such an approach would also complicate data management, as the current implementation employs compressed sparse structures for efficient storage of data on disk. This allows for reduced storage size when handling a large number of patterns. Moreover, when reading this sparse data, empty sequences can be promptly identified, eliminating the need for comparing such sequences, as two empty sequences are known to have a distance of zero. This optimization proves significant as empty sequences occur frequently.

Careful consideration should be given to the selection of events. With knowledge gained from the second approach, there is now a better understanding of which events could be employed successfully. Notably, the consideration of highs and lows, as well as the intersections of price with support and resistance lines, may prove useful in detecting meaningful patterns. While common indicators were initially explored, their effectiveness was limited. It is clear that expecting substantial results solely based on these indicators was overly optimistic.
