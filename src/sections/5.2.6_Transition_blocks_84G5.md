<!-- Transition blocks -->
Transition blocks can also be requested, similar to candle sets. As previously mentioned, stepping through the transition blocks occurs in the same manner as stepping through the candles of a typical block. The distinguishing factor is that while the candle block can be used to retrieve historical candles, the transition candles cannot facilitate this historical lookup. Hence, it remains necessary to retrieve the current and previous candle blocks. When utilizing the previous value in an expression, it is also necessary to use the previous value from the reference of a candle; meaning, this is the last value at the point in time that the last candle closed. This enables observation of how the market tends to anticipate candles interacting with indicators, and how an indicator might "touch" a candle, but when observing transition candles, it may be evident that contact never occurred.

<!-- Conclusion -->
In conclusion, the indicator processor is a pivotal tool within the pipeline, enabling the rapid generation of a diverse range of indicator blocks with varying parameters. By implementing caching when responding to clients and when fetching candle blocks, overhead can be effectively minimized when an indicator is required within a service. This efficiency allows for the generation of thousands of indicator blocks per second. Use of these indicators will be seen in the pattern detection methods within subsequent chapters. Furthermore, getting the basics right with this service is essential as it lays the groundwork for more advanced results calculations, which are categorized as algorithms.
