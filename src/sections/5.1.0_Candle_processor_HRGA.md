<!-- Explain what the purpose is -->

The data in this context consists solely of candles, making it crucial to seamlessly provide this data to other services. All services within the pattern processing pipeline make calls to either an intermediate service or directly to the candle service in order to acquire the required data. This positions the candle service as the focal point and the most crucial link in the chain of services.

While all services utilize Go for implementation, the ease with which we could leverage multi-threading in the language was a key factor in this choice, particularly when referencing its design principles [@effective_go]. Among these services, the candle service stands out as it particularly benefits from Go's multi-threading features. At any given time, the candle service might be tasked with managing up to 20 simultaneous requests, each querying for distinct candles and time intervals. Operating autonomously from other services, the constraints of the candle service are primarily determined by disk I/O and CPU speed. Given the minimal computational load, this implementation allows for the streaming of thousands of candle blocks every second.

The candle service assumes multiple responsibilities. Firstly, it retrieves and verifies all symbols that require tracking. Subsequently, it maintains up-to-date data for these symbols and offers it in multiple time intervals. Additionally, as services also need information on data availability, the candle service includes the start date of the first candle block in its response. Consequently, all this metadata can be obtained in a single request.
