This chapter delves into the heart of the exploration: pattern detection. We'll be examining two key techniques in detail: clustering and manual pattern detection.

In Section 6.1, we explore the potential of clustering for automated pattern detection within market data. We will delve into the methodology for extracting relevant features from the market and the means to interpret them. Since patterns in financial data are challenging to define within a Euclidean space, we will examine various existing techniques for clustering that can effectively handle this complexity. Specifically, this section will shed light on how unsupervised machine learning techniques can unearth patterns in market data that might otherwise remain obscured or undetected."

Section 6.2 shifts focus towards a traditional approach to pattern detection. We will explain the algorithms used to detect patterns, by using the pipeline that we have built in previous chapters. Since many patterns exist, we try to detect the most common patterns, by using highs and lows as a basis. This section sheds light on the standard patterns that traders often look for when starting with trading with patterns.
