Technical analysis, a method predicting future price movements based on historical price and volume data, has been extensively discussed in both academic and applied financial literature. One of the core components of technical analysis is the use of chart patterns. These patterns, which appear as specific geometrical configurations on price charts, are theorized to be indicative of potential future market directions. Given the extensive claims about these patterns, this chapter seeks to critically assess the literature surrounding them.

While a vast array of patterns is identified and utilized by analysts and traders, this review will concentrate on a select few that consistently appear in foundational literature: the double bottom, double top, and head and shoulders patterns. For instance, such patterns have been comprehensively discussed in Bulkowski's "Trading Classic Chart Patterns"[@Bulkowski_2002].

A critical objective of this chapter is to explore the empirical validity of these patterns. The research questions guiding this inquiry include: What evidence exists in academic literature supporting the predictive validity of these patterns? How are these patterns being detected in research, and with what outcomes?

By narrowing the focus to these foundational patterns, this chapter aims to provide an understanding of their place within the broader framework of technical analysis.
