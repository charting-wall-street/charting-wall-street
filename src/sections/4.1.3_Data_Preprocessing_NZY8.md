Upon data download, the processing phase commences. The sparsity of stock market data is notable, as it lacks night data, weekends, or holidays. To streamline the analysis, a focus is placed exclusively on daily candles, thereby circumventing complexities associated with trading day start and end times. In order to facilitate indexing and plotting, any gaps arising from closed market days are filled with empty candles, clearly labeled as missing. As a result, all data is organized and stored in an array, enabling convenient access through timestamp-based indexing.

As stocks may have distinct start times, loading an entire company's historical data into memory for every instance of its requirement can impose substantial overhead. To mitigate this challenge, the data is partitioned into blocks, with each block comprising 5000 candles. These blocks can be stored separately, either on disk or in memory, as individual data entries. Although storing a few megabytes of historical data in this manner may appear excessive, it proves essential for efficient access to assets when working with minute data or simultaneously processing multiple stocks.
