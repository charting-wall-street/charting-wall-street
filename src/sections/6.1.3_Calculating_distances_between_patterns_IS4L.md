The cornerstone of clustering revolves around computing distances between patterns. As previously explained, these patterns are composed of multiple event sequences, which necessitates a suitable metric for quantifying their dissimilarity. Since we are operating in a non-Euclidean space, the options for selecting distance algorithms are limited. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Edit Distance, and Longest Common Subsequence are the most commonly used algorithms for comparing events within this space. Among these options, DTW aligns most closely with the objectives of this thesis, although additional exploration is needed to definitively determine the optimal algorithm.

In the implementation, a variant of Dynamic Time Warping is utilized to minimize memory usage during distance calculations. As each pattern consists of sequences of the same length, memory consumption can be quantified as $n^2$. However, by leveraging Hirschberg's algorithm, memory usage is reduced to $2 \times n$, resulting in a significant enhancement in efficiency.

DTW offers more meaningful distances between events. Nonetheless, there persist performance issues worth noting. In a bid to boost comparison efficiency, we incorporate a window within the distance formula. This addition ensures temporal alignment of events when matching patterns. For each event series, distances between patterns are calculated (for instance, comparing the ema-crosses of pattern A with the sequence in pattern B), and the distances of all event series are subsequently aggregated.

The implementation differs from traditional DTW in several aspects:

1. Skipping Empty Sequences: The algorithm features a capacity to skip over empty event sequences in patterns, a function not present in traditional DTW.
2. Edit Distance with Window Constraint: The implementation uses an edit distance calculation similar to DTW but incorporates a window constraint to limit computations within a specific window around the diagonal.
3. Use of Float32 for Distances: The code employs the float32 data type for storing and manipulating sequence distances instead of different numeric types.
4. Existence of Zero Distance Function: The implementation includes a function to check if the total distance between two patterns is zero, a function not commonly found in traditional DTW.
5. Cumulative Pattern Distance Calculation: In our context, patterns are defined based on multi-sequence data. Unlike traditional DTW, which compares only two individual sequences, our implementation calculates the total edit distance between corresponding event sequences in two patterns. This cumulative calculation across multiple sequences adds a layer of complexity, distinguishing it from the standard, single-sequence comparison approach of DTW.

The optimal window size is determined to be 3, as it provides satisfactory performance for the algorithm. However, further experimentation is necessary to identify the optimal window size in a more practical setting.

Additional context regarding other variables is required for a comprehensive understanding of their roles and functions in the implementation.
