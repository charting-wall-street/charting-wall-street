Technical analysis, often known as "charting," has been a long-standing method in financial practices. It involves studying price chart patterns to predict future prices. However, one of the main criticisms of this method is its subjectivity, as interpretations can differ among users.

The paper "Foundations of Technical Analysis" [@Vu_2001] addresses this issue by suggesting a more structured and automated way to recognize technical patterns. The researchers use nonparametric kernel regression, a modern statistical method, to spot patterns in price time series. This move towards automation is inspired by successes in other areas like fingerprint and face recognition, where advanced statistical methods are used.

The study makes several key points. Firstly, while some classic patterns like the head and shoulders are informative, they might not be the most efficient. There could be other "optimal patterns" better suited to find specific patterns in financial data. However, it is essential to note that the best patterns for finding unusual data might not be the same as those for making the most money in trading.

In summary, while traditional technical analysis has its place and has shown value over the years, combining it with machine learning and updated statistical methods could be the way forward. This combination could make technical analysis more accurate and possibly more profitable.
