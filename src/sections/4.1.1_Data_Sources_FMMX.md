During the development of the tools, two data sources are utilized. One data source is EOD Historical Data [@eod_api], which provides the necessary information for stocks, while the other is Binance [@binance], which offers candle data for cryptocurrencies.

Initially, cryptocurrency data is used for the development process due to its high availability, high resolution, and cost-free access. Binance provides a well-documented API that enables the retrieval of data from the start of its inception. However, this data, due to its inherent volatility, may pose challenges in reliably detecting patterns. Nonetheless, it should be noted that higher volatility does not necessarily imply fewer returns [@Liu_Serletis_2019]. In fact, the heightened volatility might suggest that patterns could manifest more prominently and could be more effective. Additionally, a significant amount of historical data is required to assess the feasibility of patterns on large time frames, which is lacking in the cryptocurrency market due to its relative infancy. Therefore, while it might be that patterns actually work better with this higher volatility, it is a subject that warrants deeper exploration. Consequently, the decision is made not to explore this dataset further in the current context, but it remains an avenue for potential future research.

To acquire stock market data, many turn to publicly available resources. However, in the experience, these were found to be both impractical and time-consuming to extract, particularly given the limitations many services impose on the amount of historical data accessible. While it is entirely feasible to construct a similar dataset at no cost from online resources, and evidence suggests this can yield data of nearly the same quality [@Pernici_Bernardini], in the context, turning to a third-party service was more expedient. To this end, we chose EOD Historical Data, a paid platform offered by Unicorn. This platform granted us access to decades of historical stock data and company fundamentals, streamlining the data collection process without any additional effort on the part.

The stock data includes end-of-day (EOD) information, such as candles, splits, and historical company fundamentals. Candles and splits are used to calculate stock prices in the charts, while company fundamentals assist in determining the worth of companies. Leveraging these resources, a comprehensive dataset is obtained, enabling accurate pattern detection in stock market data. This dataset forms the foundation for conducting analyses and investigations in the research project.
