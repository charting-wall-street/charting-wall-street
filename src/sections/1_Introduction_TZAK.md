Since the inception of the stock market, traders consistently seek methods to anticipate and capitalize on market movements. They develop numerous strategies to help forecast these movements, with two prominent techniques being technical analysis and fundamental analysis.

Technical analysis involves visually recognizing trends and patterns in market data, often depicted in forms such as candlestick charts or other graphical representations [@Nison1991-qx]. Traders who utilize this method hold the belief that historical pricing and volume trends can forecast future market behavior [@Murphy1998-ro]. Various approaches, including the application of mathematical and statistical methods, serve as key tools in this identification process, contributing to what is known as quantitative analysis.

Contrastingly, fundamental analysis focuses more on the intrinsic quality of the company, examining factors such as the company's financial health, industry position, and market competition. Fundamental analysts believe that through careful evaluation of a company's fundamentals, they can estimate the intrinsic value of the company's stock and thus find opportunities where the current market price does not reflect this value [@Gregory-Allen_Shawky_Stangl_2009].

The emergence of online brokers [@Barber_Odean_2002] significantly reduces the barriers to entry for individual retail traders. These newcomers may lack the depth of financial knowledge compared to more experienced investors. As a result, many find it simpler to begin by identifying patterns in candle charts through technical analysis rather than interpreting complex quarterly reports and other fundamental aspects of a company.

In recent years, the interest in trading patterns has significantly grown. This surge has been propelled by the accessibility to assets like cryptocurrencies [@Ankenbrand_Bieri_2018], an endless generation of content on the subject, and the evolution of machine learning algorithms [@Jiang_2021], providing innovative ways to identify and analyze patterns.

Using patterns that have historically proven effective without the need for additional research appears like an obvious strategy to many retail traders. However, there is a considerable amount of criticism suggesting that relying solely on technical analysis equates to a coin toss, as patterns often encompass the move they are trying to predict. Additionally, it is part of human nature to perceive patterns where there are none. Therefore, it is challenging to assert whether technical analysis is effective, and further research is required [@Menkhoff_Taylor_2007].

Public opinions on technical analysis are mixed, and so is the perspective in scholarly literature. While some studies claim that technical analysis is a valid strategy, numerous others argue against its viability. An additional difficulty lies in verifying these claims, as studies often fall short in terms of the size of their dataset, disclosure of data leakage, and providing a clear explanation of their methodology. These gaps in the literature may introduce biases into their findings, complicating the process of drawing definitive conclusions [@Park_Irwin_2007].

To address these limitations, we examine trading patterns over the past several decades on a large set of stocks by identifying common patterns, assessing their prevalence, and evaluating their predictive power. The questions we therefore aim to answer are (1) How can we more effectively identify common trading patterns using advanced machine learning techniques? (2) Do these patterns have any predictive power? (3) Has the predictive power changed over time with the prevalence of machine learning?

By answering these questions, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of patterns in trading strategies, determine the optimal approach for identifying patterns, and lay the groundwork for future research by building tools that simplify the processing of stock data. By addressing the limitations in existing literature, this research contributes to the ongoing debate on whether trading patterns are a useful tool in trading strategies for both retail traders and advanced traders alike.

The structure of the thesis is as follows:

- In Chapter 2, we provide background information to give more context to the workings of financial markets and their terminology.
- In Chapter 3, we discuss existing literature and its conclusions.
- In Chapter 4, we explain the origin of the data, its limitations, and the necessary processing.
- In Chapter 5, we offer a detailed overview of how data is processed to make it fast and accessible for analysis.
- In Chapter 6, we present the methodology for identifying patterns using clustering and algorithmic approaches.
- In Chapter 7, we present the results from the identification and evaluation chapters.
- In Chapter 8, we conclude and discuss future work.
