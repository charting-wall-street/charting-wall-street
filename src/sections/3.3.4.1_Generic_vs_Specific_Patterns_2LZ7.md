In the corpus of literature examined for this thesis, chart patterns frequently surface, underscoring their importance in trading strategies. Broadly, these patterns can be categorized into two main groups:

1. **Traditional Patterns (Sourced from Established Literature)**

   Originating from academic research and established trading guidelines, these patterns represent configurations that have been consistently observed over time. Common examples include:

    - *Head and Shoulders,* indicative of a trend reversal.
    - *Double Top/Bottom,* signifying a reversal of the current trend.
    - *Other patterns,* presented in various forms like "diamonds" and "triangles", each with specific market implications.

   The reliability of these patterns is attributed to their historical validation. However, rigorous academic investigations into these patterns have been limited, with only a select number of papers examining their profitability.

2. **Novel Patterns (Identified through Machine Learning Techniques)**

   With continued research into financial markets, new techniques for pattern detection are introduced, challenging traditional notions of patterns that have been documented for decades. Methods such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and various machine learning techniques are instrumental in identifying these patterns. Among this category are the so-called 'Generic Patterns'. Unlike traditional patterns, these do not have established definitions but are recognized based on their recurrent and profitable manifestations in financial markets.

To summarize, traditional patterns offer a historical foundation, while the discovery of novel patterns, facilitated by tools like DTW and diverse machine learning approaches, indicates a promising avenue for future research and exploration.
