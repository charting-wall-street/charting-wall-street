At the core of the visualization tool is the development of a chart component, which serves as the foundation for the charting functionality. This chart component receives a range of parameters, such as asset type, interval, list of indicators, and other relevant data. By leveraging this component and its flexible parameterization, we are able to generate charts for diverse assets and customize their display based on the specific parameters provided.

It is important to note that the focus in this thesis is primarily on the development and functionality of the core chart component within the visualization tool. As such, we will not delve into the details of the UI components and their implementation. While UI components play an integral role in the overall user experience, their design and specific functionalities fall outside the scope of this thesis and are not directly relevant to the research objectives. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the chart component's structure, data handling, and rendering capabilities, which are essential for detecting patterns in the stock market.

At this stage of development, the chart component was implemented as a standard React component, utilizing an empty canvas element to visualize the chart data. React's built-in state variables were initially used to track and manage the component's variables. However, as the model structure stored a significant amount of data, relying solely on React's state management led to memory issues. The sheer volume of data, including candle and indicator data, as well as parameters related to chart position and zoom levels, posed challenges in terms of efficient memory usage within React's state management system. Consequently, we needed to explore alternative approaches to effectively handle the substantial data stored in the model structure.

To effectively manage the substantial data volume and overcome the limitations of React's state management, we implemented a separate model variable as a storage mechanism. This model variable served as a centralized repository for all the variables previously stored as state variables within the chart component.

To ensure synchronization between the model and the parameter changes, we leveraged React's effect hooks [@react_hooks]. When a variable within the chart component changed, React initiated updates. We captured these updates using the effect handlers provided by React. Subsequently, we used these updates to modify the corresponding variables within the model. This synchronization allowed us to efficiently handle the extensive data volume while also effectively managing memory.

Integrating the model variable ensured that any changes in the model were promptly reflected in the UI. Moreover, by updating only the internal state of the chart component while keeping the rest of the UI updates within React's state management, we adhered to the principles of pure components, as recommended by React's guidelines [@react_pure]. This method streamlined the development of an interactive interface, allowing users to effortlessly select symbols and indicators without any performance hindrances.
