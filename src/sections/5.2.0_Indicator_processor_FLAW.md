Indicators serve as vital tools for discerning market trends. This chapter delves into the operation of a specialized service responsible for generating indicators based on the processed candle data from the previous chapter. Consequently, it is feasible to compute popular indicators, such as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI).

The primary objective of this service is to consolidate all indicator logic into a singular service, enabling instant output for a requested indicator in real-time. Given that indicators can be requested with a range of parameters, advanced caching techniques are employed to streamline the retrieval and processing of candles.

Indicators are usually expressed as simple equations when looking at how they are calculated in the real world. These expressions can be stateful or stateless, which means a stateful expression could use the previous value. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) serves as an example of such a stateful expression:

EMA = Closing price x multiplier + EMA (previous day) x (1-multiplier)

While this appears straightforward in theory, it requires access to the complete history of the dataset for its calculation. Since the operations are performed on candles, alternative methods for approximating the full history must be explored for use in a stateful indicator, to avoid the necessity of always employing the entire dataset.

Handling stateless expressions is relatively simpler and may not require the complexity introduced by this service. However, the service does facilitate inward and outward caching of data to hasten even basic calculations when viewed in the project's scope. The Simple Moving Average (SMA) serves as an example of a stateless expression:

SMA = (A1+A2+...+An)/n

Lastly, some indicators are based on other indicators. Bollinger Bands (BB), for instance, rely on the Simple Moving Average (SMA). This necessitates the capability to calculate indicators recursively, and strive to prevent redundant calculations.
