In the top-down clustering approach, we adopt a strategy similar to K-Means Clustering. The process begins by initializing a certain number of centroids, which are representative patterns, based on a random selection from the available patterns. Each remaining pattern is then assigned to the nearest centroid based on their similarity. This assignment process is iteratively repeated for each centroid, optimizing the clustering arrangement.

To efficiently distribute the workload across multiple threads, the newly created child centroids are added to a job list that is processed by a number of worker threads. This parallelization allows for faster computation and scalability when dealing with large datasets.

Ideally, to achieve an optimal split, it would be desirable to calculate distances between all patterns. However, this can be computationally expensive. Therefore, a heuristic approach is employed instead. It involves randomly selecting a pattern and using its most distant neighbor to split the cluster. By utilizing this approximation method, we can achieve reasonably good results while minimizing computational costs.

Once the split has been made, distances are calculated for both resulting clusters. The patterns closest to each cluster are then assigned to their respective sets. This process of splitting and assigning patterns is repeated until the desired clustering arrangement is obtained.

In certain cases, there may be patterns that could fit better within a different cluster or should be placed under the same parent cluster. To address these potential errors, an audit-like procedure can be conducted when the clustering has reached a sufficient number of levels. This involves comparing all patterns with each other to identify potential alternative merges, ensuring that the clustering arrangement is refined and accurate.
