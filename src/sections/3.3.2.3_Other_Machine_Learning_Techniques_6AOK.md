The paper "Clustering of time series data - a survey" [@Warren_Liao_2005] consolidates extensive research on time series clustering, emphasizing its applicability and versatility across numerous domains. This systematic review investigates different methodologies and assumptions researchers have adopted when clustering time series data and the inherent challenges and potential research directions.

From the review, the following insights are drawn:

**Data Assumptions and Limitations:**

- A majority of the research predominantly deals with stationary time series, with few exceptions.
- Notable works address specific assumptions, such as discrete-valued time series data, data errors, or unevenly sampled data.
- A gap is evident in studies involving multivariate time series with diverse lengths for each variable.

**Multivariate Time Series Studies:**

- Certain research either overlooks cross-correlation between variables or assumes conditional independence.

**Complementary Techniques:**

- Methods like change-point detection, can pinpoint the beginning of time series, aiding in subsequent analysis.

**Differentiating Time Series from Static Data Clustering:**

- The distinction primarily rests on deriving suitable similarity or dissimilarity measures, which is crucial for clustering time series data effectively.

**Research Opportunities:**

- Modern clustering techniques, such as genetic algorithms, remain underutilized.
- There's potential in integrating both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification approaches.
- While ensembles of clustering methods might offer superior results, challenges like inconsistent labeling persist.
- A clear need emerges for algorithms designed expressly for time series clustering, especially as most scaled-up techniques cater predominantly to static data.

**Temporal Knowledge Discovery:**

- Despite its significance, time series clustering appears underrepresented in existing surveys, highlighting the need for more exhaustive research.

In summary, these papers provide an overview of methodologies, challenges, and potentials in clustering time series data. These findings can be applied when implementing a possible machine learning approach that makes use of stock data represented as time series.
