<!-- Introduction -->

The initial focus of the pattern detection efforts involved employing a clustering-based approach. The motivation behind this decision stemmed from the recognition that manual pattern detection can be a labor-intensive task, requiring significant effort and time. Consequently, we sought an alternative method that would leverage machine learning techniques to automatically detect patterns. This approach aimed to streamline the pattern detection process and improve efficiency.

The foundation of the clustering approach revolved around grouping patterns together. The underlying premise was that if the market exhibits recurring patterns, these patterns should occur more frequently than random patterns. By utilizing distance formulas such as dynamic time warping (DTW), we aimed to identify these recurring patterns regardless of their temporal intervals. Moreover, we expected that these patterns would exhibit a coherent merging pattern in terms of their occurrence count, facilitating effective clustering.
