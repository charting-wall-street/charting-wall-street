This chapter focuses on the processing of data retrieved from data brokers through the API bridge. It examines various services in detail and explores how they transform a series of candles into structured blocks of candles and indicators. These transformed data can then be readily accessed via an HTTP request.

Furthermore, caching techniques and the concept of generating transition candles are discussed as means to decrease computational requirements and streamline the complexity within the pipeline.
