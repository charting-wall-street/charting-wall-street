We embarked on this journey with three fundamental research questions about trading patterns in the financial market. The first question revolved around the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in effectively identifying common trading patterns. As we delved deeper, the nuances and complexities inherent in financial markets nudged us towards a more scripted approach, moving slightly away from a pure machine learning focus. This transition into the second research question: Does the discerned pattern truly possess predictive power in stock price movements? Finally, the third line of questioning concentrated on the temporal aspect, contemplating whether the rise in the prevalence of machine learning over the years has influenced this predictive power. Throughout this thesis, the core aim remained to sift the signal from the noise and uncover the real-world relevance of these financial patterns.

**Key Observations and Challenges**

The initial investigation focused on the potential of machine learning as a means to more effectively identify common trading patterns. However, during the exploration, we encountered challenges in its practical implementation within the confines of this thesis. These experiences prompted us to pivot towards an algorithmic approach, which yielded transparent and reproducible results.

The cornerstone of the work was the development of an extensive software pipeline. This pipeline facilitated efficient analysis of the selected stock datasets. The project made use of a microservices architecture, allowing for a network of specialized modules, each performing a specific function. Such a structure enhanced development time and offered flexibility, as individual modules could be developed without affecting existing pieces.

Interacting with the data became more intuitive due to this pipeline. Previous challenges associated with visualizing findings, such as the limitations of generic tools or the intricacies of plotting, were mitigated. The custom-built visualization tool streamlined this process, granting us the ability to visualize data as per the requirements without being constrained by external tool limitations.

Evaluating the patterns was another hurdle we faced. We recognized that viewing them solely as trading strategies provided a limited perspective. Consequently, we use the triple barrier method, aiming to discern any significant differences in success rates when contrasting these patterns against random occurrences. To make sure that the triple barrier method does not introduce any bias, we made sure to verify it against the evaluator which also logs timed-out trades.

While we've found success with the algorithmic approach, there is still potential for machine learning in this topic. With the established tools and pipeline, a renewed exploration into the machine learning domain could lead to further insights in future research.

**Discussion of Results**

The efficacy of classical patterns from the literature was put to the test to determine their predictive power, which is central to the second research question. The following observations were made:

1. The random algorithm's win rate proportionally rises with the triple barrier's threshold.
2. The double bottom pattern, though it outperforms the random baseline, offers only a minimal effect size.
3. Double top patterns, contrary to established literature, had win rates exceeding 50% in most scenarios but again with a minimal effect size.
4. Triple bottom patterns amplify the double bottom signal, yet the effect size remains small.
5. Triple top pattern's performance is inconsistent, with significant results emerging only at specific thresholds.
6. The head and shoulders pattern seemed no different from random events.

The small effect size observed in the different patterns, particularly in the double bottom and double top, may appear insignificant, but it's essential to put this into context. In the realm of trading, where win rates are often the focus, a substantial win rate would be highly unusual and could indicate an error or anomaly. Thus, even a small win rate improvement can be considered a favorable result in certain scenarios. However, the critical question remains whether these minor gains can outperform simpler and more conventional approaches, such as holding indices. The strategies based on trading specific patterns are inherently different from these broad investment strategies, and a direct comparison might not reveal a clear advantage.

This nuanced understanding of the effect size leads us to suggest caution when relying exclusively on these patterns for stock predictions. Exploring the different dynamics further, such as whether trading based on recognized patterns for short periods offers better returns compared to holding an index throughout the year, would add depth to our grasp of the practical application of pattern-based trading.

**Patterns Over Time**

In the endeavor to understand the evolving nature of trading patterns, we systematically assessed their performance over decades. The findings provide insight into the third research question â€” evaluating the change in predictive power of these patterns over time:

1. Double Bottom Pattern:  
   Over the years, the effectiveness of the double bottom pattern showed a slight decrease. However, this trend was minor and did not reach a level of statistical significance. This suggests that while there might be minor shifts in the pattern's efficacy, it has largely remained stable.

2. Double Top Pattern:  
   As a counterpoint to the double bottom, the double top pattern's predictive power remained steadfast throughout the observed period, with no notable variations.

3. Other Studied Patterns:  
   Diversifying this thesis to include other trading patterns, it was observed that the majority maintained a consistent behavior. No significant temporal trends were detected in their predictive prowess.

These findings provide insights into the third research question. Despite the rapid technological evolution, potential changes in trading methods, and the rise of machine learning, the predictive power of these trading patterns has remained largely consistent over the decades. However, this constancy might suggest an inherent limitation in these patterns' foundational efficacy, implying that their baseline effectiveness might have been suboptimal from the outset.

**Conclusion and Future Work**

As we reflect on the research, it becomes evident that relying solely on specific horizontal trading patterns for stock market predictions does not capture the full complexity of market behavior. This limitation is also highlighted in existing literature, warning against the exclusive use of such patterns. However, our exploration confirms that while there may not be a robust signal in every pattern, there are indeed discernible trends in very few of them. Even so, the effect size is minimal, and it might not be advisable to use them unless they are part of many other layers in a strategy.

The consistent behavior of these patterns over the years, despite rapid technological changes and shifts in trading practices, prompts a closer examination of their underlying effectiveness. This thesis focused mainly on horizontal patterns, but there's a new avenue for exploration in identifying patterns through trend lines and other charting techniques.

Advanced tools and clear visualization play an essential role in this process; their importance in enhancing understanding can pave the way for future exploration. With these tools, one could attempt to detect trend-line based patterns, where patterns can be found on any angle or line instead of exclusively horizontal ones, presenting a promising area that might reveal new insights. Integrating these trend analyses could also prove promising.

Finally, while the journey into the realm of machine learning was brief, its potential as a tool for future stock pattern analysis still remains an enticing prospect, especially for those armed with the right tools and a keen spirit for charting Wall Street.
