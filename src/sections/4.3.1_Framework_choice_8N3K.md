The decision to utilize the React framework [@react] for the visualization tool was guided by two key considerations. Firstly, React's component-based architecture enabled us to create interactive user interfaces by leveraging reusable components, reducing the effort required for UI development. This approach facilitated code reusability and streamlined the overall development process.

Secondly, the familiarity and proficiency with React played a significant role in the decision-making process. Drawing upon the existing knowledge, we were able to effectively execute the development process and leverage React's inherent advantages to meet the specific requirements.

React's support for real-time changes during programming, facilitated through mechanisms such as reconciliation [@Clark] and efficient rendering optimizations, proved invaluable. This functionality allowed for instant visibility into updates, minimizing the need for manual refreshes or rebuilds. Consequently, this real-time feedback greatly enhanced the development workflow and productivity.

In summary, the decision to utilize the React framework played a crucial role in the development of the visualization tool. React's emphasis on efficient rendering and the ability to quickly set up the tool were key factors in choosing it as a framework.
