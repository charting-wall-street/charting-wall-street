The evaluation of trading patterns can be approached in multiple ways. One method involves incorporating them into a trading strategy. However, there's a prevailing doubt about whether trading patterns alone can be an effective strategy. It is challenging to evaluate their influence on price movement without bias. This research aims to determine if these patterns indeed have a significant impact on future price movements, especially when compared to random points in time.

Financial markets are often characterized by randomness, but with a slight tendency to move upward over time. If one were to pick many random time points, the average future movement from these points would be expected to be a little above zero. If trading patterns are detected, one might expect a noticeable departure from this average. But the extent of this expected departure remains a subject of debate. To address this, this thesis examines time points associated with trading patterns and compares them to those chosen randomly.

In the research, we refer to these time points as "events." We'll discuss both "pattern events" and "random events." A substantial difference between the average outcomes of pattern events and random events would warrant a closer look at existing research on the topic. We'll then see if these findings align or contradict previous claims about the utility and predictability of trading patterns.
