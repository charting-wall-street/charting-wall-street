In the analysis of patterns, we exclusively utilize stocks and their splits. This approach aligns with the concept of technical analysis, which focuses solely on the visual aspect of a chart.

This consideration ensures a more nuanced selection process, reflecting the company's overall value in the market. In this section, we will explore the collection, selection, and preprocessing of the raw data.
