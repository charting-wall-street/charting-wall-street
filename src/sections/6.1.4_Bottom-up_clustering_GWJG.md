In the research, the initial approach employed is a bottom-up or agglomerative strategy for clustering. This approach treats each pattern as a leaf node and iteratively merges nodes to form parent nodes in a hierarchical manner, aiming to identify distinct trading patterns observed in the market.

It is worth noting that these patterns exist within a non-Euclidean space, as opposed to a conventional Euclidean space. To calculate the dissimilarity between patterns, a critical requirement for effective clustering, non-Euclidean distance algorithms discussed earlier in the research are utilized. The computational time primarily revolves around the distance calculations between each pair of nodes. As these calculations are applied to the entire hierarchical tree, the available computational resources are quickly depleted.

Despite concerted efforts to streamline the clustering process and reduce the number of patterns, the outcomes are unsatisfactory. The attempts to enhance efficiency do not yield significant reductions in computational time or substantial improvements in performance. Further details regarding these optimization techniques, along with their limitations and challenges, can be found in Section 6.1.7.
